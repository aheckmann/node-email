# node-email

A simple wrapper for the sendmail command

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aheckmann/node-email.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aheckmann/node-email)

## Installation

First make sure [Sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org/) is installed.

then either

    npm install email

or 

    git clone git://github.com/aheckmann/node-email.git

## Examples
    var Email = require('path/to/email').Email
    var myMsg = new Email(
    { from: "me@example.com"
    , to:   "you@example.com"
    , subject: "Knock knock..."
    , body: "Who's there?"
    })
    
    // if callback is provided, errors will be passed into it
    // else errors will be thrown
    myMsg.send(function(err){ ... })

In this example we set the global `from` property so that all
email is sent from the same address.
    
    var lib = require('path/to/email')
      , Email = lib.Email;
        
    lib.from = 'someAddress@youAlwaysSendFrom.com'
    
    // no need to set the from property, already set
    var mail = new Email(
    { to: "you@example.com"
    , subject: "Knock knock..."
    , body: "Who's there?"
    })
    mail.send()

Note that no callback was passed into `send()`, therefore errors will throw.
    
Attachment Example:

    var lib = require('path/to/email')
      , Email = lib.Email;
        
    lib.from = 'someAddress@youAlwaysSendFrom.com'
    
    // no need to set the from property, already set
    var mail = new Email(
    { to: "you@example.com"
    , subject: "Knock knock..."
    , body: "Who's there?",
    , attachments: [{
        path: "/blah/blah/blah.txt",
        name: "blah",
        type: "text/plain"
      }]
    })
    mail.send()
